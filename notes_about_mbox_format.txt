Each email starts with "From %email% %date%" Ex. "From nobody Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001"
    Dates formatted like: 3 letter day, 3 letter month, number, UTC timestamp, year
Each email ends with "%version_number%" I assume? Ex. "1.4.0.g6f2b"
If the line doesn't start with "from " then it is a forward, and not the start of a new email
